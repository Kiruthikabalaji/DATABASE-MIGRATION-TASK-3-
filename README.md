DESCRIPTION :

In this task, the objective is to perform a database migration from MySQL to PostgreSQL while maintaining data accuracy, consistency, and integrity. The process involves analyzing the structure of the source database, converting the schema to match PostgreSQL standards, migrating the actual data, and performing validations to ensure that the migration has been successful.

The migration process requires careful handling of differences in data types, syntax, and constraints between MySQL and PostgreSQL. Tools like pgloader or manual SQL scripts can be used for the migration. Post-migration validation is essential to verify that all rows, relationships, and constraints have been correctly transferred.

The final deliverables include:

Migration scripts for schema and data.

A summary report explaining the process, tools used, challenges faced, and how data integrity was maintained.
